// git is a version control system
// it preserves changes in a file and logs it 
// what is a version control?
// it is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time
// so you can recall specific versions later. 

// githb is a cloud based web service that stores git data

// forking is a tool in github that clones the source code to your git account repository

// what are git origin and git upstream?
// git origin is the files in your repository
// upstream is the source code that you fork your origin from

// git pull allows you to push changes from cloud repo to local repo
// git push allows you to take changes from local to cloud

// what is staging? 
// it's a process that stores information about what you are going to commit

// what is commit?
// commit is the same as saving your info to push to origin

// what is pull request?
// request upstream to sync with your origin

// (?) means files are uncommitted
// (+) means files are staged

// BREAK

// functions
// - basic understanding of computer program
// - demonstrate when to use a function
// - demonstrate when to use arguments
// - pass functions around data

// so far we learned
// 1. if/else conditionals
// 2. while/for loops
// 3. now we will learn functions, subroutines, and methods

// if you recall, methods are actions that can be performed on variables
// such as arrays and objects.
// you can think of it as a function built into javascript

// - .push();
// - .pull();
// - .toUpperCase();

// in order to execute a function, you need to invoke it with ();

// why do we want to use function?
// 1. can change flow of program
// 2. DRY
// 3. encapsulate functionality
// 4. separation of concern

// one thing to note, () is universal signifier of a function

// now what is a callback?
// callback is an act of taking a function and passing it into another function
// it can change the order of functions.
// callback is a function of function

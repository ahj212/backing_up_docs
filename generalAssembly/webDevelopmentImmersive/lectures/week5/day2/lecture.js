// npm package called flatfiles let you store json into a file and then you can call keys from that file and get data from it. it's almost like you're storing data. 

// what's the point of flat file?
// if you can make an entire blog around this package, you can make your own blog using flatfile and it will save all the data for you. 

// to install it
// npm i flatfile --save

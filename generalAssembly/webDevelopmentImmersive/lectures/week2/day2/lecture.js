// window.onload
// there are some possible problems you would have with the game for last night's
// homework. 

// window.onload = function() {
// }

// since the order of operation is not really top to bottom anymore with callbacks,
// we need windows.onload. once html section of the page is loaded, window.onload
// triggers.

// console.log(option_text);

// you only use an anonymous function if you're just using that function only once
// therefore, you don't need to name the function into a variable. 

// only arrays you can call indices with []
// document and window is an object, so you can call inner stuff like so

// document.~~
// window.~~
